CHARACTER SEQUENCES

The file format recognised is a simple list and symbol.

The open list symbol is "(" minus quotes
The close list symbol is ")" minus quotes

The item separator is any combination of space, newline and/or tab

All other characters sequence up to form symbols.

The parser may *optionally* provide a configuration option to change any of the separator or whitespace settings,
but it is never required to, and must default to the above behaviour


INTERNAL SYMBOLS

An internal symbol is a special sequence of characters that would otherwise form an error case,
but which can be accepted as information to the parser.

An internal symbol takes the form (() internal) where "internal" is the name of an internal symbol.


FINAL DATA FORMAT

There is only one very restricted usage of internal symbols that is standard for smooth.

This is a list of the form ((() lambda) X E)

where the head of the list is the internal symbol (() lambda)
X can be replaced only with a single normal symbol, and not a list,
and E can be replaced by any list or symbol that is not or does not contain the empty list,
and can itself contain the above lambda expression.
(except where used by an internal symbol or a list which has an internal symbol at its head)

Such a final data format must only contain one expression of the above form at its top level


PROXY PASSES

Intermediate stages (those which output in the format described by this document)
