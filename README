Notes:

The code is written for Gambit Scheme and Linux, but should not take much to port to
other Schemes and Windows.

The code at the moment is not complete and needs more work to be able to run full programs,
but is put online for those interested.

This project is not vaporware - there will be a release, but neither am I in a rush,
so things are being written such that major rewrites should not be necessary.

The compiler itself will be up to the scratch of generating a decent executable pretty soon, ie. O(months),
but it will take a while longer before the rest of the environment
(packages, macros, read table, module code optimisations etc.)
is up to scratch for writing code in the language.

If you are interested in the project, please don't start hacking on it just yet,
as I've got a number of things that are yet to be changed or implemented,
and would not want to reject a good submission because it clashed with something else.
Instead please give me a message and let me know if there's something you want to hack on.
