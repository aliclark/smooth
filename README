This is an early release. It is not intended for writing serious programs yet!

Install instructions:

(Note, this is for *nix based systems, and may need more work to get running on Windows)

1) Install gcc

2) Install Gambit Scheme. Often packaged as 'gambc' on Linux
   www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/

3) Move the file "dot-gambcini" to ~/.gambcini

4) Edit src/compiler.scm and search for ~/code/smooth
   Replace ~/code/smooth with the location where you have installed the code

5) cd into the base of your Smooth directory and run `./scc smoothlang/anc2020/test`
   This should hopefully result in an executable called "test" being created in that directory.
